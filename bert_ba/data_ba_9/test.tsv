8268	Honestly, Muriel, BA won't exist in 5 years. And I say that as someone who always tries to fly BA. Service is going downhill big style.
5014	I fly with you because there's no real alternative for me.  Lovely people, crap planes crap service, lovely people.  When was the last time BA announced on arrival that they're on time 95%?
11314	Last week was on my first   @British_Airways    flight. Philly to Prague. Economy had ~6 tvs. No prob, I'll read. But reading lights were broken in the whole plane! 7 hours of darkness with nothing to do.   @British_Airways    how do I make sure this doesn't happen on my flight back?
1513	I am unable to pay as the site won't let me and says there is an error retrieving the price quote. I have a feeling BA have withdrawn the price even though I paid 40 to hold them.

2678	I see. I advise using a credit card whenever possible for protection.  British Airways  once charged me unfairly, their CS basically told me to get lost, so I reversed the credit card charge and they lost the money plus a reversal fee which Mastercard/Bank charged them.  Good luck.

2120	 British Airways  and Lufthansa are racist, Pro Christian/Islam and anti  Native Indian. After terrible experiences., I have never traveled by    @British_Airways     since 1998 and   @lufthansa   since 1992.

10554	  @British_Airways    please can you help. We arrived into Gatwick today on BA2236 and left our iPad in the seat pocket. Gatwick Airport have advised to contact yourselves whilst we wait for our lost property application form to go through their system.
1051	Well aside from landing in New York and being told we won't get our bags until tomorrow it's been blinding

10011	  @British_Airways    yall are pros foreal foreal. Love yall  
7371	In other words why did you send a plane that couldn't accommodate all the passengers who paid for the flight?

3478	  @vueling     @britishairways    you delay a flight 3 hours 38 minutes from Italy to London, so my partner turns up to the airport late deliberately, having received the late flight alert, only to not let them check the luggage in and therefore issue a boarding pass!   #neverflyvueling  
634	"""Yes you can, Ian. You'll still be Silver when you check in. I am sorry you won't be retaining the status, there's always next year!   ^Hel"""

10442	  @British_Airways    think it's ok to post a flight as being delayed, then change it to on time without announcing it and then insult you by saying you and the other passengers saw it wrong and charge you again.   #donotflybritishairways     #fail     #CustomerExperience     #retweet   pic.twitter.com/BKwA5jTjdb

7374	Ok. Here's a thing that needs sorting: Your on line lost baggage page has my email address incorrect-who ever filled it in did it wrong. No wonder I'm being treat like a mushroom.   It is not possible to update the details. ANY email address I try and enter is errored as invalid!

5884	Hi, still nothing. Is 14 days still the estimated timeframe, I've been waiting 15 days already and still haven't heard anything?
3223	Last night I was in regular contact with City and Red Cross throughout the night plus receiving updates at 2 am and 7 am with respect to assistance provided to  British Airways  passengers.     We're very fortunate to have so many residents who step up to help whenever asked.

3956	  @British_Airways    you have lost a customer today and ruined the beginning of my honeymoon because your staff do not know process. Disappointed beyond relief. What a waste!   #neveragain     #loyaltyfail  
8684	  @British_Airways    shame on you BA. I will ask my all friends and colleagues not to fly with you.
2141	I think that's made up. I have lived all over the world and I can honestly say there is no country as tolerant of everything as the U.K. I also fly about 2 times a month. More sometimes. I have never, regardless of airline, ever heard a member of cabin crew be racist.
5635	 British Airways ?
3535	  @britishairways    Today marks my 17th call to you, and my 6th email.  I've never experienced customer service quite like yours.  And I will never, ever fly with you again.
7463	Reading people's tweets to   @British_Airways   , I feel like I should be more stressed out than I am! But   @monzo   have sorted me a new card whilst I was snoozing, just in case, and I can freeze my current one between uses to stop the Bad Guys using it...

3513	folks for the inconvenience they have caused by their incompetence.  One thing I can say for sure is I'll never fly this airline again...
3598	I keep hearing bad things about   @Qantas  , yet I've never had a bad experience. But I guess I don't use them that often. In recent years, I've a lot of excellent pointy-end flights with   @EtihadAirways  ,   @OmanAIr  ,   @CathayPacific   and even   @British_Airways   .
5171	The stress of being caught by the   @British_Airways      #BAdatabreach   clearly wasn't enough. So they cancelled my early morning flight from Ldn City to Glasgow tomorrow and told me at 5pm this evening.   #rubbingsalt  
3597	"It's no real wonder they dropped ""the worlds favourite airline"" as a byline. Whatever happened to you,   #britishairways    ? When EasyJet and RyanAir do it better for a 10th of the price, you know you're doing it wrong. Never, ever flying with you again."
