4722	Not just  British Airways , all airlines treat Indian passengers badly. In the crowded Dubai-Chn route, Emirates doesn't provide blankets unless asked. Crew as a rule are rude to Indians esp. elders and thise with kids. But have to admit, many Indian passengers are also boorish.     https://  twitter.com/timesofindia/s  tatus/1027757679798824962     ...  
8035	No other options were suitable. Spending my birthday at home instead of in Rome because of   @British_Airways    shocking system.
2796	Never ever flying   @British_Airways    again. Will move heaven and earth to avoid them in the future. Staff rude, patronising and unhelpful to a 12 y/o boy - just because he's a bit short for his age. Disgusting

8127	  @British_Airways    well done for enforcing safety rules in recent case. As a frequent traveller I'm fed up with people blatantly disregarding rules to keep EVERYONE including crying bairns safe.
3143	Because they never listened to women or people of color or anyone not a dude - look at the boardroom they have . It's like Facebook or anywhere. Privilege only gets you so far these days
5778	Japan   is somewhere I would like to go. Hopefully in the next couple of years  
7189	Glad to see you're actively replying to clients, can I get a response to my simple question from 14 hours ago?
10755	  @British_Airways    especially when the lounge is EMPTY. Me and my company spend five-figures with you on business travel. I guess you are telling me to use someone else for my holiday travel.
5072	Hope they don't lose your clubs! They have a reputation for it

7157	You are not a low cost airline,    @British_Airways    . Long haul flights should always allow at least one checked bag on economy without asking to pay extra for it.
197	""".  @British_Airways   , our flagship airline, have been spectacularly awful. Flights cancelled, won't rebook at airport, app has crashed, phone line won't respond. Website says """"You may rebook the cancelled flight(s) free of charge"""" but gives me no mechanism to do so."""
1652	  @britishairways      @AerLingus   I am on BA code share flight on Aer Lingus tomorrow. BA won't check me in and AL checking isn't available.   I have 2 kids traveling with me and I need confirmation of seats. Please tell me how to get them. Website and apps are not helpful
1309	"""It won't - but if it doesn't appear soon, we're going to have to do more shopping to include shoes and straighteners!"""
256	"""Don't worry, Peg. If the booking failed, we won't have debited your card. If the payment was authorised before the transaction failed, you may see a pending payment on your statement for a while, but this will time out. ^Beth S."""
8212	Fantastic!!     Great work, and Happy Birthday.
2440	  @British_Airways    we found someone who works at Heathrow.  They contacted a friend who has access to the World Tracer system.  The bag was input in World Tracer on August 8, and  British Airways  never checked, had no idea.
9833	  @British_Airways    trying to check in Club Europe at Athens airport but no staff available? Have they all gone on strike/siesta?   #athens   pic.twitter.com/sSs26eq2zJ 
816	"""  @British_Airways    customer service is exceptionally awful. Well done   will shortly be cancelling my BA amex card and not bothering to collect avios anymore as after the trips we have booked, we won't be flying with you again!"""
3131	  @British_Airways    is there any reason why I'm receiving texts about a flight that I've never booked?
11662	I used to design phones and now it's my job to break them. So I have a fair idea of what can go wrong and what can trigger it. I've worked with hundreds of models and only seen one that was higher risk when charging. That model was recalled very rapidly.
7017	I concur!
11115	Got the standard bull shit answer

9229	That it did.  Led to a lot of very important structural breakthroughs via tragedy.  I remember seeing a video on how they discovered hoop stress by placing it underwater and playing with pressurisation.
2813	"  @British_Airways    rep: ""Is there anything else I can help you with today?""  Me: ""Unless you can upgrade me to first class for free, I think that's it!""  Both of us burst out laughing for awhile.    @British_Airways    rep: ""I really wish I could. Thanks so much. Never stop smiling!"""
2240	  @British_Airways    on the last day of our honey moon in Paris, my wife and I woke up at 4:30 in the morning and drove to the airport to find out our plane to London was delayed and we would miss our flight home. We never got a notice. Why? We are beyond upset and disappointed.
9315	Thanks Neil, i am sure it will be! Looking forward to the flight!

3666	You'll be lucky to get any response, never mind a prompt one. I'm now on day 21 of a GDPR & More complaint and have heard nothing but tumbleweed.
3398	94 minutes of wasted phone calls, hanging on in the vain hope of someone answering and you deem that acceptable?? I was calling from Spain at my expense. Will never fly BA again
4025	Nope   @easyJet    my mate paid around the same amount of money as me to go to Berlin for 3 days me just 2 flights on the same day never again

9250	I finally got an official email stating the amount of compensation and asking for my bank account info. (Thanks for that.) I sent the info yesterday, can you just confirm you've received it properly? And if possible, tell me when the transfer is going to take place? Thanks!

11381	  @British_Airways    said this last time I complained and nothing happened. I'd like to reconvene with your customer complaints department - your brand is taking advantage of their customers. Pls dm me. Thx.
5245	  @British_Airways    Please could I have a proper response to case number 18430477? Knowingly taking money for specific seats which weren't available, needs a full explanation. The response to-date is unsatisfactory, lazy and disrespectful.

2123	  @British_Airways    never did anything wrong ! EVERYBODY knows that for safty reasons everybody including kids HAVE to sit in seats and use seatbelts otherwise the plane cant take off and they WILL be unloaded ! Before people fly they need to read the law/rules and comply !!
