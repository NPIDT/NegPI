1033	France won't name new Ambassador to Iran.  British Airways  suspends flights to Iran. New Trump sanctions coming soon to Iran. Iran's oil out put diminishing quickly.  Am I wishing too much the regime in Iran falls by the end of 2018?
5200	i don't know if you've ever been to a pret a manger but that's definitely not the case, they're prewrapped and labelled baguettes in a fridge that you take up to the till to pay for. and allergen information in the uk is i'm pretty sure a legal requirement on food labels
4447	Oh well after receiving the email this morning that I may have been impacted, it's fair to say I will never fly BA again unless I have no other alternative
3751	This is why you should only fly on the big guys like  British Airways , Emirates, United, ANA, ect. At least you know if they cancel or something they have partnerships with other airlines so you'll never be stranded. This is the gamble with these low cost carriers   #PrimeraAir

3429	I never learn. Booked my partner to meet me in Nice later. So obvs   @British_Airways    cancel the flight. Don't worry they say we've rebooked you- he's now got to take 2 sep flights, leave 2 hrs earlier, travel for 6 hrs instead of 2, and arrive so late he misses the entire evening.
2686	Insult of insults.    @British_Airways    sends us a customer survey regarding a complaint we registered more than a year ago when my daughter got food poisoning on their flight, and which they never resolved. Then ends 10 minute survey by saying they cannot address our complaint.
1754	"How would you know they would ""never"" contribute? You might say that about some on the VPRS but would you shut it down? Violent as in previously force-recruited to a militia? Too simple and linear I'm afraid."

4178	Oh please! After the day you have put us through , along with 89 people who missed there connecting flights and this the second flight in a row you have had this sort of impact on for us. I am certainly going to go out of my way to never fly BA again.

8323	  @AmericanAir   your customers service after 45mins without any warning just transferred me to  British airways . Did not advise the BA change team and now they are saying they cannot help me. This is bar far the worst customer service I have ever received in my life!
8604	  @British_Airways    breach... The breach that keeps giving!  At lest they are not trying to hide the fact and they are trying to be helpful to those affected unlike most other big companies that suffered breaches lately!      https://www.  infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ba-breach  -an-extra-185k-customers/     ...

8587	  @British_Airways    The 12.40 from Gatwick to Toronto tomorrow already showing as delayed?  Can I just check this is a real delay and not a systems issue?

11292	As a very good friend of mine always says of   @British_Airways   , they are the world's most expensive budget airline!
1978	Your flight from from Heathrow to Madrid was delayed by over an hour causing me to miss my connecting flight which also left the airport in Madrid early and to top that off I wasted money for my hotel that night which I never turned up to and had to stay in Madrid for 12 hours!
3139	Thanks   @britishairways    for cancelling my return flight at my best friends wedding. I'll NEVER fly BA again.
6985	  @British_Airways    you've just cancelled my flight tomorrow and have rebooked me on a later flight from an airport I don't live near to a destination I don't want to visit. I want to speak to someone about this now. And your lines are closed.  How is this acceptable?
1759	I have never seen BA as an airline of good service standard, not even when I used to travel on their planes every year in the 90s.  Their air hostesses have always had that air of superiority.  The same goes for CX unfortunately.
4948	Hi!    @AmericanAir   my family and I have flown with you, we booked through   @British_Airways    from LAX to AMM and my infants bag has been lost for over 2 weeks! the service desk is clueless, We need my baby's stuff ASAP.  I can send you the case number privately. HELP!!!
7937	True. But in the Indian cultural context there is ALWAYS a veggie option so I think Indians who aren't frequent travellers are not always aware they need to guarantee it by ordering specially. I'd just order extra veggie meals for the India flights -- you'll def need them.
9733	Godspeed Emile. A little different from ZS-ERO.
2775	Oh goodness!!!! Never flying   @AlaskaAir   or   @British_Airways   .  I am so sorry you are going through this!  They better reimburse you and your family for all of the inconvenience this is causing you!

3499	  @British_Airways    any chance you know where my luggage is? Was asked to check in hand luggage at Heathrow, but it never arrived in Budapest. Luggage tag BA688490 on my way to a wedding and currently have no clothes to wear!

3181	  @British_Airways    useless airlines. Misplaced bag on 8/31 and still haven't received it even though they located it last Friday 9/7. I was told the bag will reach me by 9/9 but that never happened. Sent their CEO and exec team email so now I feels it's retaliation by them.

9289	  @DailyMailUK   do you need any stories/evidence against   @British_Airways    treating families atrociously? Flight cancelled (unavoidable)but no information from the company, no food or drink or accommodation provided. No staff on the ground and they are unresponsive online.
1905	Oops, I can never tell the difference
7163	  @British_Airways    sent you a DM yesterday and no response. What are your response times?
10981	I'm not too sure what you mean by reservation number?
9473	  @British_Airways    what are you doing about the stranded passengers at Gib airport. No one is giving us any information.
3998	Hi Gearoid.  We're sorry your choice of seat has been changed.  We can never guarantee a particular seat to anyone, as there can be a aircraft change or can be done for someone who needs the seat for medical reasons. ^Neil

5605	Good morning   @British_Airways    Nice flight 114 from JFK. Shame about the bus we had to take at LHR T5 - it really does ruin the experience. Surely it wouldn't take much planning to prioritise gates for long haul traffic?!

7555	I take it all back.   @aegeanairlines   not having flown them for more than 10 years is trouncing   @British_Airways    for service staff appearance, seating. Well impressed. Looking forward to trying out their equivalent of club Europe.
