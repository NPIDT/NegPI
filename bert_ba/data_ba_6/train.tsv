3429	0	a	I never learn. Booked my partner to meet me in Nice later. So obvs   @British_Airways    cancel the flight. Don't worry they say we've rebooked you- he's now got to take 2 sep flights, leave 2 hrs earlier, travel for 6 hrs instead of 2, and arrive so late he misses the entire evening.
4808	0	a	 British Airways  is famous for ill treating Indian passengers. I vividly remember in late 90s how they did not treat veteran Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan properly on a flight from London. I explained to the cabin crew that he was a veteran of Tamil movies and deserved respect.

2802	1	a	Thanks. Rebooking would come at great additional cost even after getting money back from insurers. Bizarre BA don't allow name changes when other airlines (  @easyJet  ,   @Fly_Norwegian  ,   @Ryanair  ,   @SAS  ) do. There's no point in flying BA over budget and for good reason. Never again.

8654	0	a	No. Positioning is where we are on the flight as a passenger in order that BA can get us somewhere in order to fly an aircraft for them. In this case it is because we are replacing the B747 on the later Johannesburg service with an A380 so they need us there to fly it back.
