9583	Absolutely disgraceful that   @British_Airways    won't change the name of a passenger on a PS800 Atlantic flight! Instead they want me to cancel (in which I will not receive a refund) and re book at the higher price of PS1200... This is not acceptable. Please RT.   #britishairways

3045	  @British_Airways    After years of flying with British, I will never do so again. They ripped us off with charges that we did not have to pay. We were laughed at when we checked in for paying unenecessey fees after checking in online last night. They used to be a premier airline...
2243	No, not really. The staff knew a day earlier that the plane would be delayed but never sent anything. I feel that is plenty of time to send a notice. Now we have to miss our original flight out of London to America, and we had to pay out of pocket to make sure we get home.
