6407	  @British_Airways    Hi. How do I make a group booking if some passengers are economy basic and others are economy plus? Not everyone in our group wants a suitcase.

1576	  @British_Airways    Deeply disappointed with BA response to my complaint from Sept. BA cancelled my flight to LHRvand made no provision for onward flight to JFK. Would have been left high and dry. All the cost implications are mine they said. Won't be my first choice in the future
