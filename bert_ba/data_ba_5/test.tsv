6122	Just thinking that last night , think flights on it were too dear for most folk that's why nothings took its place . Not cost effective either I'm sure  British airways  and Air France lost a small fortune on it
7935	does the 787 carry more passengers than the 380? gonna miss watching the 380 on approach to OR Tambo. the sheer size of that plan always amazes me
5732	Very sad :( Ryanair the shits.
3612	Can you also explain how your son would never be so stupid to eat food without knowing the ingredients before? People aren't realizing this girl didn't have to eat on the plane given her condition. She took a chance and now she's dead.
9738	True, and they don't have a chicken curry recipe to bribe me with to fix it for them
222	You have a fab body we won't mind you showing it off     usual BA!
968	 British Airways  announced that they would no longer take Zim dollars. Western union announced that they would no longer give Forex. We went to Gono's Office. My sister did because she is my hero. She said I won't leave until you give me forex to pay for these tickets
