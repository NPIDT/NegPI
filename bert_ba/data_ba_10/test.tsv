6555	Hi - I'm so upset I was charged ten times the cost of my valid tickets or threatened to be left in Lyon. I was fully checked in, had 90 mins
2139	Thanks   @British_Airways    for a beautiful last descent over London tonight. After 5 years of landings we move to pastures new but tonight you gifted me farewells of Southbank and Battersea, Barnes & Richmond... I'll never forget.
6470	  @British_Airways    hi guys, I held 4 flights yesterday but the price has gone down today for the exact same tickets. Will I get my PS40 back if I proceed with the lower fares or will I lose it ? How does it work ? Cheers

9512	And so i had my travel agent reconfirmed I had a aisle seat, which he did, arrived at the airport and guess what: Middle seat!   #BritishAirwaysScam  . It is not justified, nor justifiable to charge passenger for their preferred seat on a plane. This has no cost for the the airline.
3335	Will never forget my first take-off coming home from HK. Sat in lounge 1.5hrs whilst intense storm raged. Boarded during temporary lull. Storm returned. Waited another hour or so. I had no fear. Knew was in safe hands with BA. Those guys (& I include guy-esses!) are the best.

781	  @British_Airways    i am in disbelief that when you book a international business class ticket             on BA your are still on the hook for a few hundred more       for a seat assignment. That's insane. Won't make the mistake of booking work travel on BA ever again.
8081	  @British_Airways    how much do you save by not serving juice and instead this concentrate nonsense? I wouldn't mind if the cost of flying with airlines that actually provide proper business class services wasn't half of your prices.
6416	Anyone ever checked in for a flight using the  British Airways  app? What a pile of cunt!   #BritishAirways      #ShitApp     #FirstWorldProblems  
8953	Out of curiosity: assuming a Rails app with YAML-based i18n in the templates, how would you sort locale-aware? Custom view helper that sorts in Ruby after i18n?
421	Isn't it your responsibility that your team is not helping in allotting flight departing on same day as i have booked? The Booking agent is also unable to help because your team won't budge. Its upto you to help

4038	I never check a bag when I go to Vegas as it's usually a relatively short trip. I don't think the fares are sneaky, they give an option to those who want to fly cheaper and not take a bag! Only about PS30 more each way to add a bag in any case
3978	  @British_Airways    Quick question... I have a 0645 flight out of Gatwick on the 21st - what time is Check In?  Never flown in a plane before, so I want to know before I book trains
4077	its a deal that got pulled very quickly so lets just call it limited number release never call it that other term e&%or fare ;)
5048	So, thanks to   @British_Airways    I won't be able to buy anything online for the next 2-5 days until my new card arrives. On the bight side, multiply that by 380,000 peeps and it could be a mini boost for the High Street!
