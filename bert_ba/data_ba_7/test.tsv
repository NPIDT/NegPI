3079	Hi Sarah! Yes I did, except I only got two copies of the same baggage claim number and one of my two bags arrived after a few days. Kenya Air shows they never received the bag from BA. Speaking with someone at IAD to understand why and find this is necessary at this point.

5177	Thanks, I have the app and it's still showing but want to double check. The flight isn't BA you're correct but all flights are booked with partners so show up on one whole booking with BA

2823	  @British_Airways    cancelled our flight without any prior notice. No help in re-booking the flight. Never going to fly again with your company. Disappointed.   Thanks to   @Expedia   that we could book another flight. Also the staff is so courteous :)
8412	Some people are to thick to write to the airlines, same as all these bank claims, thickos. PPI claim is a 2 sentence letter to your bank or 25% to some shyster

6350	  @HeathrowAirport   absolutely disgusting behaviour from your people at Heathrow. Delayed   @British_Airways    flight meant my girlfriend was not allowed to go to my connecting flight by one of your staff. We could have made the flight but were stopped! Atrocious.

3595	  @British_Airways    sunday BA2765 - how your staff deal with an onboard ranting customer - give the lady free whiskey - if that wasn't scary enough cups flying out the open cupboard on landing!! Horrible flight nice to see people being shouted at the boarding gate too - never again

3772	I responded to that message and never got a reply. Your customer service over the last few months of my last 2 trips inclusive of the one concerned that was cancelled is completely and utterly shocking. No explanation given or customer care. Shocking.
1582	Yet again   @British_Airways    disappoint. App won't let us download out boarding passes and then we are forced to check in bags. Consider the price of your service this is not good enough.
5228	Don't overwind the elastic band
5198	I think the fact that the people being referred are more likely to belong to other races is the reason for that, Lippy. There probably aren't as many white people coming illegally to the UK as there are from non-western countries.
